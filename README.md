## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

See [TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) for 40+ test cases covering:
- Discovery queue flow
- Classification and ranking
- Data persistence
- Export/import
- Mobile responsiveness
- Edge cases

### Quick Smoke Test

1. Open the app
2. Start Discovery Queue
3. Classify 5-10 movies
4. Go back to main menu
5. Verify stats updated correctly
6. Try ranking (if you added 2+ to watchlist)
7. Refresh page - data should persist
8. Test Export/Import

## 🛠️ Development

### Data Generation

The movie data is generated from `top_1000.csv`:

```bash
node generate_movies.mjs
```

This creates `movies.js` with stable slug-based IDs.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Backup Your Data
Export your data regularly! It's stored in your browser, so clearing browser data or switching devices will lose it.

### Ranking Efficiently
- You don't need to rank everything—just enough to know your top picks
- The more comparisons you make, the more accurate the ranking
- Skip pairs if you genuinely can't decide

### Batch Size
Currently fixed at 10 movies per batch. Future versions will let you customize this.

### Mobile Experience
- Works great on mobile browsers
- Add to home screen for app-like experience (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Ranking algorithm uses random pair selection (can be inefficient for large lists)
- No undo feature (coming in future update)
- Skipped movies reappear in next batch (by design, not a bug)

See [CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md) for detailed technical analysis.
